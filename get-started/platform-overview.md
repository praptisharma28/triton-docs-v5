# Platform overview

Triton customer portal is where you get your endpoint and token, monitor usage, and top up the balance. This page is a quick tour so you know where to find everything.

## Common tasks

Here's where to go in the dashboard for the things you'll do most often. What you can do depends on your role -- new members default to **Standard**, which covers almost everything. Expand a role below to see what it includes.

<details>

<summary>Standard (default)</summary>

Read-mostly access plus self-serve actions: view usage and cost, top up credits, set low-balance notifications, contact support, add domains to the origin allowlist, invite teammates.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Operator</summary>

Everything Standard does, plus provisioning new endpoints and rotating tokens.

Need Operator? Ask in the dashboard chat -- support can upgrade you.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Admin</summary>

Organisation owner. Full access to billing, endpoints, members, and dangerous actions like deleting an endpoint or transferring ownership. Contact support to add or transfer the Admin role.

## Walkthroughs

Short clips to walk you through the most common tasks, from sign-up onward.

### Sign up

1. Go to [customers.triton.one/users/sign-up](https://customers.triton.one/users/sign-up) with your work email
2. Click the verification link in your inbox
3. Name your organisation (the billing root for everything)
4. Provision your first endpoint -- pick **Solana mainnet** and your closest region

### Add a teammate

1. Open **Members** in the sidebar
2. Click **Invite**
3. Enter the teammate's email
4. Click **Send** -- they get a one-click join link

### Add a domain to the origin allowlist

1. Click into the mainnet subscription
2. Click the endpoint name to open its settings
3. Under **Allowed origins**, hit `+`
4. Add the domain and save -- all subdomains are allowed automatically

### View usage

2. Review the per-product totals (requests and bandwidth)
3. Drill into per-endpoint breakdowns below
4. Click **Export CSV** in the top-right to download

### Top up credits

2. Describe what's happening
3. Include your endpoint URL and the timestamp of the issue
4. Your message goes straight to engineering -- not a tier-1 queue

# Shield MEV protection

Learn more about Shield in our blog post: [Introducing Yellowstone Shield 🚫🛡️](https://blog.triton.one/introducing-yellowstone-shield)

### What is Shield?

Yellowstone Shield lets you control which validators can process your Solana transactions. It's a simple but powerful idea: create a list of validators you trust (allowlist) or don't trust (blocklist), and your transactions will only go to the validators that match your criteria.

**Why use Shield?** Some validators engage in practices that can harm users, such as:

* **Sandwich attacks** - Inserting transactions before and after yours to extract value
* **Frontrunning** - Copying and executing your transaction idea before you
* **Other harmful MEV strategies** - Various techniques to extract value at users' expense

Shield helps you avoid these validators by simply not sending your transactions to them.

### How It Works

1. **Create a Policy** - You create an on-chain list of validators (either "allow these validators" or "block these validators")
2. **Own Your Policy** - When you create a policy, you receive a special token that gives you control over that policy
3. **Use the Policy** - Add your policy's address to your transactions
4. **Automatic Filtering** - The RPC checks each validator against your policy and only sends transactions to approved validators

**What happens to blocked transactions?** If the current validator doesn't meet your criteria, the transaction is dropped - it won't be sent to that validator. The system doesn't hold or queue transactions.

**Note about time-critical transactions**: Since Shield can drop transactions when no eligible validators are available, be careful using strict policies with time-sensitive operations like arbitrage or liquidations.

**Important**: This only works with Shield-enabled RPCs (like those using Yellowstone Jet). Standard Solana RPCs will ignore the policy parameter.

### Quick Start

If you're already using an RPC that supports Shield (like Triton RPC with Cascade), just add the policy to your transaction:

#### RPC Method Parameter

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "sendTransaction",
  "params": [
    "<base64_encoded_transaction>",
    {
      "encoding": "base64",
      "skipPreflight": true,
      "forwardingPolicies": ["<your_policy_pda>"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### HTTP Header (Alternative)

```
Solana-ForwardingPolicies: "<your_policy_pda>,<your_policy_pda2>"
```

### Understanding Policies and Tokens

When you create a Shield policy:

* An SPL token (using Token Extensions) is created
* You receive 1 token in your wallet
* This token gives you control over the policy
* As the creator, you keep the mint authority and can mint more tokens if needed
* Anyone holding the token can manage the policy (add/remove validators)
* The policy lives on-chain and can be used by anyone who knows its address

**Note**: Since the token is fungible and more can be minted, you could potentially share policy management with others by minting and sending them tokens.

### Important: Protection Limitations

Shield policies are **not automatic protection against harmful validator practices**. Here's why:

* Policies only block validators that are on your blocklist (or not on your allowlist)
* New validators join Solana every epoch
* Validators engaging in harmful practices (like sandwich attacks or frontrunning) can appear at any time
* **Policy maintainers must actively update their lists** to catch validators that harm users

Think of it as a filter, not a guarantee. The quality of protection depends entirely on how well the policy is maintained.

### Finding and Using Existing Policies

#### Policy Explorer

Visit [validators.app/yellowstone-shield](https://www.validators.app/yellowstone-shield?locale=en\&network=mainnet) to:

* Browse all existing policies
* See which validators are included/excluded
* Copy policy addresses for your transactions
* Check when policies were last updated

#### Common Policy Types

**Allow Lists**

* Top validators by stake
* Geographically distributed validators
* Performance-based selection

**Block Lists (Deny Lists)**

* Validators known for sandwich attacks or frontrunning
* Poor performing validators
* Community-flagged validators

### Creating Your Own Policy

#### Prerequisites

* Solana CLI installed and configured
* SOL for transaction fees
* A list of validator addresses

#### Step 1: Install Shield CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-shield
cd yellowstone-shield
cargo build --release --bin yellowstone-shield-cli
```

#### Step 2: Prepare Metadata

Create a JSON file describing your policy:

```json
{
  "name": "My Validator Policy",
  "symbol": "MVP",
  "description": "Blocks validators known for sandwich attacks",
  "image": "https://your-image-url.com/image.png",
  "external_url": "https://your-website.com",
  "attributes": []
}
```

Upload this file to IPFS or Arweave and save the URL.

#### Step 3: Create the Policy

```bash
# For a blocklist (deny these validators)
yellowstone-shield-cli policy create \
  --strategy deny \
  --name "My Validator Policy" \
  --symbol "MVP" \
  --uri "https://your-metadata-url.json"

# For an allowlist (only allow these validators)
yellowstone-shield-cli policy create \
  --strategy allow \
  --name "My Validator Policy" \
  --symbol "MVP" \
  --uri "https://your-metadata-url.json"
```

The CLI will output your policy's mint address - save this! You'll receive 1 token and retain mint authority, allowing you to mint more tokens later if you want to share policy management with others.

#### Step 4: Add Validators

Create a text file with validator addresses (one per line):

```
ValidatorAddress1...
ValidatorAddress2...
ValidatorAddress3...
```

Then add them to your policy:

```bash
yellowstone-shield-cli identities add \
  --mint <your_mint_address> \
  --identities-path validators.txt
```

#### Managing Your Policy

To manage a policy (add/remove validators), you must hold at least 1 token in your wallet. If you've transferred all your tokens to others, you'll lose the ability to manage the policy.

**Update validators (replace entire list):**

```bash
yellowstone-shield-cli identities update \
  --mint <mint_address> \
  --identities-path new_validators.txt
```

**Remove specific validators:**

```bash
yellowstone-shield-cli identities remove \
  --mint <mint_address> \
  --identities-path validators_to_remove.txt
```

**View policy details:**

```bash
yellowstone-shield-cli policy show --mint <mint_address>
```

### For RPC Providers

If you're running your own RPC and want to support Shield:

1. **Using Yellowstone Jet** - Shield support is built-in
2. **Custom Integration** - Use the [yellowstone-shield-store](https://crates.io/crates/yellowstone-shield-store) crate to:
   * Cache policies locally
   * Check validators against policies
   * Integrate with your transaction forwarding logic

### For Developers

Shield policies only work with RPCs that support them. You can't use the standard Solana web3.js methods - you need to make direct RPC calls:

```typescript
// Prepare and sign your transaction
import { Transaction } from '@solana/web3.js';
import bs58 from 'bs58';

const transaction = new Transaction().add(/* your instructions */);
const signedTx = await wallet.signTransaction(transaction);
const serializedTx = bs58.encode(signedTx.serialize());

// Send with Shield policy
const response = await fetch('https://your-shield-enabled-rpc.com', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id: 1,
    method: 'sendTransaction',
    params: [
      serializedTx,
      {
        encoding: 'base58',
        skipPreflight: true,
        forwardingPolicies: ['<policy_pda>']
      }
    ]
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
const signature = result.result;
```

### Key Points to Remember

1. **Policies need maintenance** - New validators appear every epoch. Lists must be updated regularly to remain effective.
2. **It's just a filter** - Shield simply prevents transactions from going to certain validators. It doesn't guarantee protection from sandwich attacks or transaction failures.
3. **Token = Control** - When you create a policy, you get an SPL token. Anyone with this token can manage the policy. As the creator, you can mint more tokens to share control.
4. **Anyone can use your policy** - Once created, anyone who knows the policy address can use it in their transactions.
5. **Not all RPCs support Shield** - Only use Shield-enabled RPCs like those using Yellowstone Jet.

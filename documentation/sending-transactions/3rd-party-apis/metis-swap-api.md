# Metis swap API

To utilise Triton One's self-hosted Metis Swap API Binary, you do not need to have any $JUP tokens staked; Triton One has got you covered.

### What is Metis?

Metis is Jupiter's routing and quote engine that brings the power of Jupiter's routing directly to your infrastructure. It scans 20+ DEXes and AMMs across Solana's DeFi ecosystem, calculates optimal routes, splits trades when beneficial, and builds ready-to-sign swap transactions.

#### Key Features

* **Liquidity aggregation**: Combines liquidity from multiple AMMs and DEXes into a single route
* **Platform fees**: Support for platform fees directly in the quote API - set your fee wallet and pass a platform fee parameter
* **ExactOut mode**: Perfect for payment flows where you need to receive an exact output amount (e.g., accepting many tokens but settling in USDC)
* **Circular arbitrage:** Triton enables circular arbitrage routes (e.g. USDC → token → USDC), which are disabled on Jupiter's public API by default

#### Use Cases

Metis API on Triton can power:

* Wallets with simple swap functionality
* Payment gateways that accept many tokens and settle in a single asset
* Trading bots and arbitrage systems (incl. circular arbitrage strategies)
* DEX frontends with clean swap flows

### Getting Started

To start using the Metis Swap API, use the following pathing in your code:

```bash
curl 'https://<endpoint>.rpcpool.com/<private_token>/metis/quote?
```

#### Example Request

```bash
curl 'https://endpoint.rpcpool.com/private_token/metis/quote?\
inputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&\
outputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112&\
amount=1000000&\
slippageBps=50'
```

### Pricing

The self-hosted Metis Swap API uses metered billing and is not rate-limited.

The price per million Metis queries is $80. There are no rate limits to using this API; therefore, it is recommended to monitor your usage to prevent unexpected costs.

### Availability

Metis Swap API is available for all customers with an active Solana Subscription, on both shared RPC pools and dedicated nodes.

### Executing a Swap

After getting a quote from the <mark style="color:$success;">`/quote`</mark> endpoint, you can execute the swap:

1. **Get a Quote**: Use the <mark style="color:$success;">`/quote`</mark> endpoint (as shown in the example above)
2. **Get Swap Instructions**: Use the response to build your swap transaction
3. **Sign and Send**: Sign the transaction with your wallet and submit to the network

The Metis API builds ready-to-sign swap transactions for you.

#### Example Flow

```bash
# Step 1: Get a quote
curl 'https://endpoint.rpcpool.com/private_token/metis/quote?inputMint=...&outputMint=...&amount=...'

# Step 2: Use the quote response to execute the swap
# (See full documentation for swap endpoint details)
```

For complete details on executing swaps, including the <mark style="color:$success;">`/swap`</mark> and <mark style="color:$success;">`/swap-instructions`</mark> endpoints, refer to the Metis documentation.

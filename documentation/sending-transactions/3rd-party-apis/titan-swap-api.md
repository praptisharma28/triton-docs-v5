# Titan swap API

### What is Titan?

The Titan Swap API allows you to stream price updates in real-time. The Argos routing engine serves as a meta-aggregator, sourcing data from multiple DEX aggregators and RFQ sources.

Titan Prime offers a unique websocket implementation that streams quote information. This significantly lowers latency and allows front-ends to update prices in real-time without overwhelming the server with HTTP requests.

#### Key Features

* **Real-time** **Streaming**: WebSocket implementation for continuous live price updates
* **Meta-Aggregator**: Sources from multiple DEX aggregators and RFQ sources to minimize slippage
* **Low Latency**: Stream quotes faster than REST polling
* **Dynamically Allocated Real Time Routing:** [DART](https://titan-exchange.gitbook.io/titan/developer-doc/dart-swap-api/overview) dynamically re-optimizes trades at the exact moment of execution, not just at quote time — guaranteeing best execution when it matters most.

#### Use Cases

Titan Swap API is ideal for:

* Trading interfaces requiring real-time price updates
* Price monitoring dashboards
* Trading bots that need low-latency price feeds
* Wallets with live swap pricing

### Getting Started

To access the Titan Swap API through Triton One, use the following pathing:

```
wss://<your-endpoint>.rpcpool.com/<your-token>/titan/api/v1/ws
```

Please make sure you use <mark style="color:$success;">`wss://`</mark> and not <mark style="color:$success;">`https://`</mark> as this is a websocket-based service.

#### Example Connection

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://your-endpoint.rpcpool.com/your-token/titan/api/v1/ws');
ws.onopen = () => {
  console.log('Connected to Titan Swap API');
};
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Price update:', data);
};
```

### Executing a Swap

When you receive quote updates via the WebSocket stream, each quote contains swap route information:

1. **Connect to WebSocke**t: Establish connection (as shown above)
2. **Request Swap Quotes**: Send a <mark style="color:$success;">`NewSwapQuoteStream`</mark> request with your swap parameters
3. **Receive Quote Stream**: Get continuous updates with the best routes from multiple providers
4. **Select a Quote**: Choose the best quote based on your criteria (price, provider, etc.)
5. **Execute**: The quote contains either:

* **Instructions**: Build and sign a transaction with the provided instructions
* **Transaction**: A ready-to-sign transaction that you can directly sign and submit

Each <mark style="color:$success;">`SwapRoute`</mark> in the stream includes all the data needed to execute the swap.

For complete details on the request/response format and executing swaps from streaming quotes, refer to the official documentation.

### Pricing

The cost for using streaming services with Triton One is $0.05 per GB.

### Availability

Titan Swap API is available for all customers with an active Solana Subscription, on both shared RPC pools and dedicated nodes.

# Customer dashboard

If you already know what you want to do and just need the steps, the [**Customer dashboard tour**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/ACym6ZbIwDBDKhyKgDGy/platform-overview) walks you through the most common actions.

## Signing in and getting help

<details>

<summary>Where can I get help with my Triton account?</summary>

You can contact us anytime through the support channel on your [customer dashboard](https://customers.triton.one).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why can't I sign in with Google?</summary>

Google single sign-on is reserved for Triton One employees and isn't available on customer accounts. Sign in with your Triton username and password instead.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why won't my email work to sign in?</summary>

The login form takes your username, not your email address. If you've forgotten your username, click **Forgot your username** at the bottom of the form, enter your email, and we'll send it to you.

</details>

## Account security

<details>

<summary>How can I add domains to the allowed origins?</summary>

In your customer dashboard, click into the mainnet subscription. On the right, click the endpoint name to open its settings. Under **Allowed origins**, hit `+` to add a new one and save. All subdomains are automatically allowed.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I exposed my API key. What should I do?</summary>

Please contact us ASAP through the support channel on your customer dashboard. We will urgently provide you with a new one and decommission the exposed key.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does Triton secure dedicated node endpoints?</summary>

Dedicated node endpoints use:

* **API keys:** unique per client, revocable from the [customer dashboard](https://customers.triton.one).
* **Rate monitoring:** alerts for unusual spikes to detect misuse.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I have multiple API keys for the dedicated nodes? Can I manage them by myself?</summary>

Yes. If you have an operator role, you should be able to add them yourself.

</details>

## Billing and usage

<details>

<summary>How do I top up my balance?</summary>

Open your customer dashboard, go to **Billing**, and click **Buy credits**. You can pay in stablecoins via:

* **Wallet Connect.** Connect your wallet and pay with any supported token.
* **Transfer from anywhere.** Send stablecoins from any external wallet or exchange.

If you'd rather pay by card or wire, switch to invoiced billing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I set up low-balance notifications?</summary>

Yes. Open your customer dashboard, go to **Billing**, toggle alerts on, and set a threshold (for example, $10). When your balance hits that amount, every user on the account gets a notification.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Where can I see my usage?</summary>

In your customer dashboard, open the **v3 Billing** tab. You'll see total requests and GB used (the two dimensions you're billed on), plus a per-service breakdown table below with product-level detail. To export it, click **Export CSV** in the top-right corner.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why did my gRPC bill spike all at once?</summary>

gRPC streaming is metered when the connection closes. If you hold a stream open for several hours or a day, the full bandwidth charge is applied to your account once it disconnects.

Also, usage data refreshes every \~4 hours, so you can expect a lag between actual traffic and what's reflected in the dashboard.

</details>

## Invoicing and payments

<details>

<summary>When will I receive my invoice, and what period does it cover?</summary>

If you're on a pay-as-you-go plan, you can top up your account in the [customer dashboard](https://customers.triton.one) any time.

If you receive invoices, we send two kinds:

* **Invoices for dedicated nodes and expected monthly use of shared RPC** are sent on the first day of each month as prepayment for the upcoming month's services.
* **Any overages** are invoiced early in the following month, covering the previous month's usage.

We're working on getting both of these onto a single monthly invoice, but for right now, you could receive two.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there a due date for paying the invoice?</summary>

Yes, all invoices are due within 7 days of the issue date.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What payment methods do you support?</summary>

For invoiced customers, we accept:

```
- USDC (SPL on Solana, ERC-20 on Ethereum, Tron, Polygon)
- Payments through hel.io (USDC)
- Credit cards via Coinflow
- Wire transfers in GBP and USD

For pay-as-you-go, we accept stablecoins only.
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I cancel my subscription?</summary>

For pay-as-you-go customers, you can just stop using the service. Your prepaid balance stays valid for one year and expires after that. There's nothing to cancel.

```
For invoiced customers, give one calendar month's notice through the support channel in your [customer dashboard](https://customers.triton.one).
```

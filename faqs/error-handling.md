# Error handling

A step-by-step process to diagnose and fix issues with your Triton One RPC.

## Reality check -- ensure your setup is correct and as expected

* Verify that you're using the correct RPC endpoint, headers, and authorization token.
* Double-check if your request format, parameters, and input data are correct.
* Ensure your code compiles without any errors and warnings with side effects.
* Review your code for possible logical bugs not caught by the compiler.

## Troubleshooting -- determine the cause of your errors

First, determine if the error is Solana-wide or specific to Triton by attempting the same method against the Solana public RPC `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`.

If the same issue exists with Solana, identify the bug and resolution by following the standard list of [Common Solana JSON-RPC codes](error-handling/common-solana-errors).

If you fail to resolve your issue on Solana's public RPC, it's time to troubleshoot with possible and known Triton One errors:

* Determine if your issue returns any of the [Triton RPC error codes](error-handling/triton-rpc-error-codes).
* Determine if your issue exhibits any of the [possible Triton RPC symptoms](error-handling/triton-rpc-error-codes).
* Determine if your issue fits any of the [uncommon Web3JS errors](error-handling/common-solana-errors) we helped some of our customers resolve.

If you fail to resolve your issue despite the steps above, it's time to call in the big guns!

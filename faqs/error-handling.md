# Error handling

A step-by-step process to diagnose and fix issues with your Triton One RPC.

## Reality check -- ensure your setup is correct and as expected

* Verify that you're using the correct RPC endpoint, headers, and authorization token.
* Double-check if your request format, parameters, and input data are correct.
* Ensure your code compiles without any errors and warnings with side effects.
* Review your code for possible logical bugs not caught by the compiler.

## Troubleshooting -- determine the cause of your errors

First, determine if the error is Solana-wide or specific to Triton by attempting the same method against the Solana public RPC `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`.

If the same issue exists with Solana, identify the bug and resolution by following the standard list of Common Solana JSON-RPC codes.

If you fail to resolve your issue on Solana's public RPC, it's time to troubleshoot with possible and known Triton One errors:

* Determine if your issue returns any of the Triton RPC error codes.
* Determine if your issue exhibits any of the possible Triton RPC symptoms.
* Determine if your issue fits any of the uncommon Web3JS errors we helped some of our customers resolve.

If you fail to resolve your issue despite the steps above, it's time to call in the big guns!

## Reach out -- seek help from the Triton One support team

Prepare the following information:

* Which endpoint are you using?
* Which token or origin are you using for authentication?
* Which service are you using (HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, etc)?
* Which error are you receiving?
* When did it happen (please include the date, time and timezone)?
* What is the expected result?
* If your issue is related to latency, how did you measure it?

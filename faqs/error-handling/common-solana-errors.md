# Common Solana errors

## Common Solana JSON-RPC codes

This is a standard list of common JSON-RPC error codes you may experience. For a comprehensive list, please refer to [Anza's kit repository](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit).

| Error code | Suggested action                                                                                                                                         |

| -32001     | Ensure your transaction uses the latest Solana transaction version.                                                                                      |
| -32002     | Ensure all required signatures are present and valid.                                                                                                    |
| -32003     | Verify keypair, rebuild the transaction with a current blockhash and sign it immediately before submission, check signatures format, and simulate first. |
| -32601     | Method not found > the method you are trying to use is either invalid or does not exist. Verify the method is enabled in your custom RPC configuration.  |
| -32602     | Invalid method parameter(s). Double-check your request format against Solana's JSON-RPC spec.                                                            |

## List of uncommon Web3JS errors

Here are some uncommon `@solana/web3.js` errors we have previously helped our customers with, which might help you troubleshoot your problem.

### Port exhaustion in NodeJS

Suppose you're running high-throughput asynchronous loads in a NodeJS environment. In that case, you might find yourself getting persistent socket and connection errors such as: `ECONNREFUSED`, `ECONNRESET`, Connection Timeout Error, other side closed, fetch failed.

If so, Triton One provides a [comprehensive guide](https://app.gitbook.com/s/VeEf321LwceAVlSk9USV/solana/error-handling/web3js-socket-connection-issues) on why this occurs and the steps to fix it.

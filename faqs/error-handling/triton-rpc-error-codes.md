# Triton RPC error codes

## Possible Triton RPC symptoms

### Requests consistently time out

**Problem:** Overloaded server or network congestion on nodes.

**Explanation:** Excessive load on a node or pool (e.g., shared RPC) could exceed capacity, causing timeouts. This might be tied to insufficient scaling or a failure in load balancing.

### Error 500 ("Internal server error")

**Problem:** Unexpected failure in Triton One's server software or database.

**Explanation:** A bug, crash, or resource exhaustion (e.g., memory leak) on our servers could disrupt request processing, unrelated to client input.

### Error 502 ("Bad gateway") occurs across multiple requests

**Problem:** Upstream validator connectivity issue or gateway misconfiguration.

**Explanation:** Triton One's routing to Solana validators might be disrupted (e.g., validator downtime, network partition), breaking the request chain.

### Error 503 ("Service unavailable") is returned frequently

**Problem:** Triton One's servers are overloaded or undergoing maintenance.

**Explanation:** High traffic or an unannounced outage could overwhelm node capacity, triggering this error until load balancing or failover kicks in.

### Error 504 ("Gateway timeout") persists after retries

**Problem:** Slow or unresponsive upstream validator response via Triton One's gateway.

**Explanation:** Our nodes might be waiting too long for validator responses due to network delays or validator lag, which is beyond client control.

### WebSocket connections drop unexpectedly with no client-side changes

**Problem:** Triton One's WebSocket server instability or capacity limit reached.

**Explanation:** A node restart, overload, or subscription cap (e.g., exceeding 100 on public pools) could terminate connections on our end.

### Transactions submitted via Triton One's RPCs are not included in blocks, despite valid fees

**Problem:** Staked node prioritisation failure or validator sync issues.

**Explanation:** Our staked nodes might not be propagating transactions effectively, or they might have fallen out of sync with the Solana network.

### Latency spikes (e.g., >100ms) occur without client-side traffic increase

**Problem:** Triton One's node performance degradation or GeoDNS routing failure.

**Explanation:** A node might be underperforming (e.g., CPU overload), or traffic might not be routing to the nearest server, leading to increased response times.

### Flapping traffic

**Problem:** Load balancing or failover system malfunction.

**Explanation:** The Load balancer might be inconsistently distributing traffic, or failover to backup nodes could fail, leading to unstable request handling.

### Historical data requests (e.g., via Superbank) return incomplete or stale results

**Problem:** Archival node sync failure or Clickhouse integration issue.

**Explanation:** Our archival nodes might not be fully synced with Solana's history, or data egress from Clickhouse could be delayed.

### Dedicated node users see "Access denied" (403) despite valid API keys and IPs

**Problem:** Configuration mismatch or authentication server error on Triton One's side.

**Explanation:** Our backend might have failed to update the whitelist or key permissions, potentially blocking legitimate access.

| Method not allowed, unsupported method. Review your custom RPC documentation for allowed methods.                                                                                                                                                                  | 405                  | Client                 |
| Retry the request after a short delay. Check your network connection and reduce request size if possible. Resubmit with a higher priority fee to speed up processing.                                                                                              | 408                  | Client                 |
| Check Triton One's changelog in the customer portal for updated methods. Switch to supported alternatives or request a custom endpoint.                                                                                                                            | 410                  | Client                 |
| The request payload exceeds the maximum size limit. Optimise your transaction, remove unnecessary instructions or split into multiple transactions or request an adjustment to your endpoint's capacity through support.                                           | 413                  | Client                 |
| You've hit the custom rate limit set for your dedicated node plan, or a misconfigured client is overloading the endpoint. Slow down your request frequency or upgrade to a dedicated node with higher limits.                                                      | 429                  | Client                 |

Retry after a delay and contact us if the issue persists.                                                                                                                              | 503                  | Server                 |
| Gateway timeout. After a short delay, retry, resubmit with a higher priority fee to expedite processing, and reconnect to the WebSocket endpoint.                                                                                                                  | 504                  | Server                 |
| Verify the market ID, as it might be a faulty API endpoint to which you were redirected. Please let us know so that we can add some additional verification of the API's health.                                                                                   | MARKET\_NOT\_FOUND   | Client                 |
| The connection was closed, not just the streams. Reconnecting the stream will not work; you must establish a new connection.                                                                                                                                       | Stream removed       | Client                 |
| Verify the token's tradability on a DEX or Solana Explorer. Might need additional verification of the API health.                                                                                                                                                  | TOKEN\_NOT\_TRADABLE | Client                 |
| The client or server cancelled the call. Check your client code for premature cancellation.                                                                                                                                                                        | CANCELLED            | Both                   |
| An unhandled error occurred, e.g., a node crashed, or an upstream Solana validator returned an unrecognised status. Retry the request, transient issues might resolve.

| Server shutting down. Retry the call after a delay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | UNAVAILABLE          | Server                 |
| Some data is transmitted (e.g., request metadata written to TCP connection) before the connection breaks.                                                                                                                                                          | UNAVAILABLE          | Client                 |
| The server is down, or there is a network issue. Fix: Retry with exponential backoff or check server health.                                                                                                                                                       | UNAVAILABLE          | Both                   |

Request a higher limit.                                                                                                                                                             | RESOURCE\_EXHAUSTED  | Server                 |
| The client does not have enough memory to hold the server response. Implement exponential backoff and reduce request frequency. Close unused WebSocket subscriptions. Upgrade to a dedicated node for higher limits.                                               | RESOURCE\_EXHAUSTED  | Client                 |
| Reduce message size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | RESOURCE\_EXHAUSTED  | Both                   |
| Verify your API key and IP whitelist. Ensure credentials match channel settings.                                                                                                                                                                                   | UNAUTHENTICATED      | Both                   |
| The requested resource doesn't exist or isn't synced on the custom node. Verify the resource ID, ensure your custom endpoint is configured to include the resource.                                                                                                | NOT\_FOUND           | Client                 |

  Use Triton's known-good Linux test client to tell whether a gRPC error is in
  your endpoint or your code.

# Is it the endpoint or your code?

If your gRPC subscription is throwing errors and you're not sure whether the endpoint or your code is at fault, use Triton's prebuilt test client.&#x20;

It's a small CLI we ship for exactly this purpose, known-good code that runs on your machine and hits your endpoint with the same gRPC subscription patterns your app does.

## Download

The client is a prebuilt binary for Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04. Download from the [yellowstone-grpc releases page](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-grpc/releases).

It runs on Linux only. If your backend runs on a different OS, run the client on a temporary Linux box (a small VM or container is enough), the goal is just to send a known-good request from anywhere and see what comes back.

## Run a subscription

Subscribe to all account writes and slot updates:

```shell
./client-ubuntu-22.04 --endpoint https://<your-endpoint> --x-token <your-token> subscribe --accounts --slots
```

Subscribe to a specific program (e.g. Raydium):

```shell
./client-ubuntu-22.04 --endpoint https://<your-endpoint> --x-token <your-token> subscribe --accounts --slots --accounts-owner 675kPX9MHTjS2zt1qfr1NYHuzeLXfQM9H24wFSUt1Mp8
```

Add `--stats` to see total accounts, slots, and bandwidth in real time:

```shell
./client-ubuntu-22.04 --endpoint https://<your-endpoint> --x-token <your-token> subscribe --accounts --slots --stats
```

## Interpreting the result

* **Stream is healthy, events are flowing.** The endpoint is fine. The error is in your application code, most often a filter that doesn't match what you think it does, an outdated client SDK version, or a parser that mis-handles a Protobuf field. Re-check your subscribe request and your data handler.
* **Stream errors or won't connect.** Open a chat in your [customer dashboard](https://customers.triton.one) and include the exact `client-ubuntu` command you ran plus the error output.&#x20;

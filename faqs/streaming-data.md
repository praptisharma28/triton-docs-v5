# Real-time streaming

Questions about gRPC streaming, WebSocket connections, and the Yellowstone ecosystem of streaming components.

## Project Yellowstone

What is Yellowstone and which subscriptions include streaming access?

<summary>What is Project Yellowstone?</summary>

Project Yellowstone is Triton's suite of high-performance tools and open-source frameworks designed to enhance RPC and data infrastructure for the Solana ecosystem.

It addresses critical infrastructure challenges: real-time data streaming, historical ledger access, ultra-low latency queries, and custom indexing.

Key components:

| Tool           | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dragon's Mouth | Core gRPC streaming engine for Solana. Delivers raw real-time data directly from the validator with ultra-low latency using Protobuf.                  |
| Whirligig      | WebSocket counterpart to Dragon's Mouth -- built for front-end or browser-based apps needing live account and transaction feeds.                       |
| Fumarole       | Persistent streaming layer with automatic redundancy and 4-day caching. Ensures no data loss even if the connection drops.                             |
| Steamboat      | Custom indexing engine that accelerates heavy gPA queries by up to 99%, cutting latency for large programs.                                            |
| Old Faithful   | Full-ledger archival service providing access to Solana's complete historical transaction data -- ideal for analytics, re-indexing, and backtesting.   |
| Jet            | A transaction submission software that lets you add Stake Weight to your transactions to route them through a priority lane during network congestion. |
| Shield         | Anti-MEV protection layer integrated with Jet. Allows configurable allow- and block-lists to prevent sandwiching and other frontrunning behaviours.    |

<summary>How can I install Yellowstone on my server?</summary>

You don't need to install anything. All Geyser streaming products (Dragon's Mouth, Whirligig) are pre-installed on Triton infrastructure and enabled automatically for all subscriptions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is Geyser streaming available with all subscriptions?</summary>

Yes. All subscriptions include Geyser streaming by default, with no setup required. It's available as soon as your subscription is active.

</details>

## Yellowstone components

The questions about streaming products built on Yellowstone.

<details>

<summary>What is the maximum number of accounts I can subscribe to using Yellowstone gRPC?</summary>

For shared plans, the current limit is \~150,000 account subscriptions per HTTP connection.

For dedicated nodes, there's no set limit. However, opening too many subscriptions for your servers to ingest can cause backpressure from your backend, leading to poor streaming performance. Please check that your server can handle the amount of data you are subscribing to.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is Steamboat, and how does it improve latency?</summary>

Steamboat is Triton's account indexing engine that delivers `getProgramAccounts`, `getTokenAccountsByOwner`, and `getTokenAccountsByDelegate` up to **50x faster** by serving them from tailored PostgreSQL indexes instead of full account scans. Indexes are built automatically from your query traffic. Available on every Triton plan at standard RPC rates -- no premium for indexed reads. See Steamboat.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is Fumarole, and how can I get access?</summary>

Fumarole is a streaming system designed for reliable, scalable streaming of account and transaction data. It aggregates data from multiple Solana nodes for high availability and persistence, with up to 4 days of retained stream history. Available on every Triton subscription, with regional endpoints (`ams.rpcpool.com` for Europe, `nyc.rpcpool.com` for the US). See Fumarole.

</details>

## gRPC and WebSocket

Connecting to streaming services from backend code, browsers, or via Geyser plugins.

<details>

<summary>Can I use gRPC from a web browser?</summary>

No, gRPC is not supported in web browsers due to HTTP/2 and protobuf limitations. It is designed for backend applications. For frontend use, use Whirligig WebSockets instead.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do endpoints support WebSocket connections?</summary>

Yes, on both shared and dedicated infrastructure. Your existing WebSocket connections automatically route through Whirligig WebSockets -- our gRPC-backed WebSocket layer that delivers intra-slot account updates at `processed`, full `blockSubscribe` and `transactionSubscribe`, and significantly higher subscription limits than native pubsub. No code changes required.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I connect to WebSockets?</summary>

Replace `https` with `wss` in your RPC endpoint URL. For example: `wss://your-endpoint.rpcpool.com`. For backends, we recommend using gRPC instead -- see Dragon's Mouth gRPC for the lower-latency path.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I use Geyser plugins?</summary>

Geyser plugins can be enabled on our dedicated Solana nodes. They provide powerful, real-time streams of on-chain data. Contact our support team to discuss your specific needs and we can configure a node for you.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I keep getting errors on my gRPC subscription. How can I check if the issue is with my endpoint or my code?</summary>

Run our prebuilt `client-ubuntu` test client. It's a small Linux CLI we ship for exactly this purpose -- known-good code that hits your endpoint with the same gRPC subscription patterns your app does. If it errors, the issue is on the endpoint and we should look at it. If it streams cleanly, the issue is in your application code.

Full guide: Verify your gRPC endpoint.

## Troubleshooting

Common operational questions when a stream isn't behaving the way you expect.

<details>

<summary>My stream connects but no events are flowing</summary>

The most common cause is a filter that's too narrow. Try widening it (subscribe to all transactions or all token-program account writes) to confirm data is reaching you, then tighten back to what you actually need. Also check your commitment level: `processed` shows everything as soon as the validator sees it, while `confirmed` and `finalized` add buffering.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I'm getting 401 or 403 errors</summary>

Verify your endpoint URL and secret token from the [customer dashboard](https://customers.triton.one). For Whirligig, the token is part of the URL: `wss://<endpoint>.mainnet.rpcpool.com/<token>/whirligig`. For gRPC services, the token is passed as the `x-token` metadata header, not in the URL. If you've recently configured allowed origins, double-check your origin matches what's whitelisted.

</details>

<details>

<summary>My stream keeps disconnecting</summary>

Networks drop. Production clients should implement reconnect-and-resubscribe logic with exponential backoff. For Dragon's Mouth, you can resume from your last-seen slot using the `from_slot` field on `SubscribeRequest`. For Fumarole, reconnect with the same persistent-subscriber name and the cursor server-side picks up where you left off.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Events feel slower than expected</summary>

Three things to check. First, your commitment level: `processed` is fastest, `confirmed` and `finalized` add latency. Second, geographic distance: connect from a backend close to our streaming clusters. Third, your processing speed: if your event handler can't keep up, the server-side queue backs up and you fall behind.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Memory grows over time</summary>

Your handler is processing events slower than they arrive. Filter more aggressively to reduce volume, parallelise your handler across workers, or move heavy processing to a background queue and keep the stream loop minimal.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I need to send keepalive pings?</summary>

Sometimes. Some cloud providers (e.g. Cloudflare) close idle streams. If you see disconnections after periods of low traffic, send a periodic ping. Dragon's Mouth gRPC accepts a `ping` field on the subscribe request; Whirligig accepts `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ping"}`. The server returns `pong` every 15 seconds you can use to confirm liveness.

# Benchmark gRPC endpoints with Thorofare

How to benchmark Solana RPC and Yellowstone gRPC endpoints the right way using Triton's Thorofare tool. Compare providers on like-for-like workloads, not on ping times.

Most Solana RPC benchmarks are misleading. They measure ping or one cherry-picked method, then publish numbers that don't reflect real workloads. **Thorofare** is the tool we built to benchmark the way that actually matters: realistic request mixes, realistic concurrency, and metrics that match what your application sees.

For the long-form rationale, see the [How to benchmark Solana RPC endpoints](https://blog.triton.one/how-to-benchmark-solana-rpc-endpoints/) blog post.

## What Thorofare measures

* **HTTPS RPC latency and throughput**: request/response round-trip across the methods your app actually calls.
* **Yellowstone gRPC subscribe throughput and lag**: account, transaction, slot, block updates. Measures how far behind real time the stream falls under load.
* **Per-percentile metrics**: p50, p95, p99 latency. Means hide the tail; tails are what hurt your users.

## When to run it

* Choosing between RPC providers: give every provider the same Thorofare profile and compare apples to apples.
* Validating a region change: did moving from `nyc` to `ams` actually reduce p99?
* Diagnosing degraded performance: is the regression in our infrastructure or your client code?

## Run a benchmark

Thorofare lives in the Triton GitHub. Clone, build, and point it at any RPC or gRPC endpoint with a token.

The full setup, profile examples, and metric interpretation are in the [Thorofare blog post](https://blog.triton.one/how-to-benchmark-solana-rpc-endpoints/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Thorofare runs on your machine. Run it from a backend close to where your real production traffic originates, benchmarking from a different region distorts every result.
{% endhint %}

## Common pitfalls

* **Cold cache vs warm cache.** First-request latency is always higher. Discard the first N requests in your analysis or run a warm-up phase.
* **Rate limits as latency.** If you exceed a provider's rate limit, you'll get 429s that look like high latency. Lower your concurrency until 429s drop to zero, then measure.
* **Single-method benchmarks.** Real apps mix `getAccountInfo`, `getProgramAccounts`, `sendTransaction`, and subscriptions. A `getSlot`-only benchmark says nothing about anything else.
* **Public RPC fairness.** Public endpoints are throttled aggressively. Benchmark against your own paid endpoint, not the public default.

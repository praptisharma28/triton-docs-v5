# Access your endpoint and token

Where to find the endpoint URL and secret token in your customer dashboard, and how to use each one in backend vs browser code.

Every Triton subscription ships with one or more endpoints. Each endpoint has a **URL** and a **secret token**. You'll use both for every request.

## Find them in the dashboard

1. Open the [customer dashboard](https://customers.triton.one) and sign in.
2. In the sidebar, click **Endpoints** (or pick the endpoint from the dashboard home).
3. The endpoint detail page shows:
   * **Endpoint URL** -- `<your-endpoint>.mainnet.rpcpool.com` (or `.devnet.rpcpool.com` for devnet)
   * **Secret token** -- a long random string. Click **Reveal** to view, **Copy** to copy.

If you don't have an endpoint yet, click **Create endpoint** in the top right, pick **Solana mainnet** (or devnet for testing), and choose a region.

## Use them

The token is appended directly to the endpoint URL for HTTP and WebSocket calls. For gRPC, the token goes in the `x-token` metadata header.

```
https://<your-endpoint>.mainnet.rpcpool.com/<your-token>
```

```
wss://<your-endpoint>.mainnet.rpcpool.com/<your-token>/whirligig
```

```
endpoint: https://<your-endpoint>.mainnet.rpcpool.com:443
header:   x-token: <your-token>
```

## Browser apps: don't ship the token

Anything visible in DevTools is public. For frontend code, leave the token out of the URL and configure an **origin allowlist** in the dashboard instead. Triton serves requests only from the domains you've whitelisted.

```
https://<your-endpoint>.mainnet.rpcpool.com/
```

Setup steps and the full token-leak playbook are in Auth and security.

## Rotate or revoke

The dashboard's endpoint page has **Rotate token** (issues a new token, old one becomes invalid immediately) and **Delete endpoint** (revokes everything tied to the endpoint). Use rotation if you suspect a leak; use delete to retire an unused endpoint.
